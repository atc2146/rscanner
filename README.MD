# Resume Scanner
  
Side project

## Project Structure

There is a folder called 'rough_work' that is in the .gitignore file.  Put all your rough work here (such as your Jupyter notebooks) so it doesn't get uploaded into GitHub.  This folder lives at the same level as the README.


## How to run

* open up Powershell
* go to the code directory, Example: C:\Users\YOURNAME\Documents\rscanner\code
* type python main.py
`
## Documentation
* Try to follow the function docstring format as given in the example in code/read_file.py

## GitHub Quick Reference
* Make sure you never dev on master!
* cd into the rscanner root folder (where the README is)
* **git status** : to see the status of the project
* **git add .** : adds all files to the staging area
* **git commit -m "some comment"** : adds a commit with a comment
* **git push origin branch_name** : pushes the branch
* **git branch branch_name_another** : creates a branch called branch_name_another
* **git checkout branch_name_another** : goes to the branch branch_name_another
* **git push origin branch_name_another** : pushes changes to be reviewed
* Note: before you create a branch, you want to pull the latest file changes from master. To do this, go back to the master branch via **git checkout master**.  Then **git pull origin master**
