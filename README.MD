# Resume Scanner
  
Resume feedback tool inspired by the resume scanner on the cultivated culture website. 

## Input

Reads a .docx, .pdf, or .txt file 

## Output

Checks for:
* resume length
* measurable metrics
* email address
* linkedin url
* phone number
* word frequency

## Project Structure

There is a folder called 'rough_work' that is in the .gitignore file.  Put all your rough work here (such as your Jupyter notebooks) so it doesn't get uploaded into GitHub.  This folder lives at the same level as the README.

## Documentation
* Follows the function docstring format as given in the example in code/read_file.py

## GitHub Quick Reference
* Make sure you never develop on master!
* cd into the rscanner root folder (where the README is)
* **git status** : to see the status of the project
* **git add .** : adds all files to the staging area
* **git commit -m "some comment"** : adds a commit with a comment
* **git push origin branch_name** : pushes the branch
* **git branch branch_name_another** : creates a branch called branch_name_another
* **git checkout branch_name_another** : goes to the branch branch_name_another
* Note: before you create a branch, you want to pull the latest file changes from master. To do this, go back to the master branch via **git checkout master**.  Then **git pull origin master**
